📌 Title
TASKIE

🎯 Objective
To create a basic command-line task planner that allows users to store, view, and manage daily tasks using simple C programming concepts like arrays, loops, switches, and string handling.

📝 Description
This program acts as a lightweight planner where users can store up to 15 tasks, each up to 200 characters long. It provides a menu-driven interface that allows the user to add new tasks, view a specific task, view all saved tasks, or exit the program. The tasks are stored in a 2D character array, and input is handled using scanf, getchar, and fgets to allow multi-word entries.

📋 Menu Options
ADD TASKS – Add a new task into the planner
VIEW TASKS – View a specific task by entering its number
VIEW ALL TASKS – Display all saved tasks
EXIT – Terminate the planner

✨ Features Implemented
Store up to 15 tasks
Each task can be up to 200 characters
Menu-based interface for easy navigation
Safe input handling using fgets()
Validation to prevent invalid task number selection
Displays individual or all tasks based on user choice

📚 Concepts Used
